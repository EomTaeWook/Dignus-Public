**High-performance modular framework ecosystem focused on runtime efficiency and GC avoidance.**  
All modules are designed for performance-critical environments with zero-copy and zero-GC architecture.

## Highlights

- **Zero Allocation:** Designed to eliminate GC overhead during runtime  
- **Zero-Copy Architecture:** Direct buffer access across networking layers  
- **Expression Tree Compilation:** Reflection-free execution for critical paths  
- **Thread-Safe Design:** Synchronized variants for concurrent environments  
- **Extensible and Modular:** Each module can operate independently or as part of a full-stack system
