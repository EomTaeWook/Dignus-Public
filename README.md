## Dignus.Core

**High-performance modular core library for the Dignus.**  
Zero-GC collections, coroutine scheduler, lightweight DI container, and extensible framework.

### Modules
| Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Collections** | Zero-GC, high-throughput data structures for real-time and network systems |
| **Coroutine** | Lightweight async coroutine system without async/await overhead |
| **DependencyInjection** | Minimal DI container using expression tree compilation for fast runtime resolution |
| **Framework** | Middleware pipeline, object pooling, and singleton utilities |

### Highlights
- Zero-GC memory model  
- Expression-based constructor compilation  
- Modular and composable design  
- Thread-safe collection variants  
- No external dependencies (pure .NET Standard)

## Dignus.Sockets

**High-performance, event-driven async socket library built for extensibility and speed.**  
[![Performance Benchmark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Performance-Benchmark-blueviolet?logo=github)](https://github.com/EomTaeWook/ServerPerformanceBenchmark)

### Key Features
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Async Session Model** | Event-driven, per-session TCP architecture using SAEA |
| **Pluggable Protocols** | Replaceable serializers and packet handlers |
| **Protocol Pipeline** | Attribute-based mapping of packet IDs to handler methods |
| **Custom Middleware** | Authentication, logging, and security pipeline hooks |
| **Session Extensibility** | Component-based session customization |

### Core APIs
`Session`, `ServerBase`, `ClientBase`, `ISessionComponent`,  
`ProtocolHandlerMapper<THandler, TBody>`, `ProtocolPipelineInvoker<TContext, THandler, TBody>`

### Design Focus
- SAEA-based I/O for max throughput  
- ArrayQueue-based send buffer for minimal GC  
- Expression Tree dispatch for handler performance  
- Fully event-driven async session model
